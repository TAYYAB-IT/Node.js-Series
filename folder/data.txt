In this part, we are going to talk about above us and stream in and stream is to let us using the data

before fully to read.

And there are two ways to read the files.

And now you can see I already paste a large text file and there are a lot of parts here.

And one way is to wait until it has been read and the other is to pass the piece of data halfway through.

And a small chunk of data has picked up into a first and sent it on to the stream every time to for

it.

So now we back to the project and go to the app called Jazz, and we are going to delete this command

and we are going to create a stream to read that file.

So we are going to create a constant stream echo to create a stream.

And we are going to post a file to this so that we are going to read this file to file an enemy's passport

text.

So next year we type we stream stored on data and then tunc and we're stream on data and been listening

to the data everand on this stream.

So every time we get a chunk of data and we will fire this Corbat and this callback is going to do a

download, we indicate that this is a new chunk of data and then we also lock the chunk.
